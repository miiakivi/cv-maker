# CV-Maker

The goal was to dive into React and practise using it by building an app where users can build their own CV using apps
components.

### [LIVE VERSION](https://miianyy.github.io/cv-maker/ "Link to my projects gh-pages")

## General

User can add their name, job title, and contact information and describe their talents and life goals. They can also add
as many education and work history sections as they want.

After CV is filled, the user can choose a color theme and save the
product in PDF file to their machine.

I used a regular expression for client-side form validation. All information provided by the user is stored in local
storage. If the user wants to later add new information or add new sections to the CV, they don't need to start from
scratch.

### What I learned

This was my first React project and first real look inside how React works so I learned a lot.

* How to use React and Webpack together
* What are useState, useEffect and useRef and how and where to use them
* How to make reusable components that can be used through the whole project
    * Not just React components but regular functions too. I learned a lot how not to repeat myself through out this
      project
* How to make html element to a pdf page and save it to your machine
* How to use CSS flexbox
* Form validation on the clients side
